# Angular2UserExample

A small website to display user data from [jsonplaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

## Install
To set up everything, simply run `npm install` in root folder. This will download all dependencies. To do this you obviously need to have NodeJS and NPM installed on your machine.

This project was generated and build with help of [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.4.
You can also install Angular CLI globally via npm with `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in the browser of your choice. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Alternatively you can run `npm start` to do the same.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
Alternatively you can run `npm run build` to do the same.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Alternatively you can run `npm run test` to do the same.

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
